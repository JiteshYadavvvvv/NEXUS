## 🔒 Overview

**NEXUS** is not just another dashboard—it's the absolute central nervous system for all student organizations at the Army Institute of Technology, Pune. Built for speed, scale, and modern aesthetics, it unifies the fragmented club ecosystem into a single, seamless, high-performance platform.

## ✨ Ecosystem

The NEXUS infrastructure is split into discrete, highly-optimized components to ensure maximum velocity and maintainability:

| Module | Description | Repository |
|-----------|-------------|------------|
| **NEXUS Frontend** | The core visual application for end-users, built with React + Vite. | [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/Jitesh-Yadav01/NEXUS) |
| **NEXUS Backend API** | Robust, scalable Express.js REST API powering the entire system. | [![GitHub](https://img.shields.io/badge/github-%23121011.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=github&logoColor=white)](https://github.com/MyTricks-code/sync-backend-api) |
